Purwalenta is an ed-tech startup. In early 2020, I decided to leave Purwalenta because of the lack of time to continue maintaining its technology. Initially, Purwalenta is built using Go with EBI (Entity-Boundary-Interactor) architecture.

# Background

I released it to public repository as a facilitator for anybody out there who seeks for reference how the EBI architecture is built from another perspective. Basically, picture below is showing how the architecture diagram looks like.
