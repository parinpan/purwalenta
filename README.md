# Purwalenta

Purwalenta is an ed-tech startup. In 2019, I decided to leave Purwalenta because of the lack of time to continue maintaining its technology. Initially, Purwalenta is built using Go with EBI (Entity-Boundary-Interactor) architecture.

# Background

I released it to public repository, just in case there is anybody out there seeks for reference how the EBI architecture works from another perspective.
